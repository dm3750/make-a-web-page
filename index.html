      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <em>The WORLD WIDE WEB</em> is collection of documents being communicated between computers all over the world.  These documents are called HTML’s (hypertext markup language).  When you click on a web page, your PC sends a request to the server associated with that page.  This request is sent via a protocol called HTTP.

        HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
          Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents are made up of <b>text</b>
          content which describes <em>"what you see"</em> and
          <b>markup</b> which describes
          <em>"how it looks"</em>, and <b>references to other docs</b> such as <em>"images, videos, etc"…</em>.

        Tags in HTML Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML documents are made up of strings of <em>Tags, Content and Text</em> which together create and
          <b>"element"</b>. Various Tags point to specific commands that a browser interprets and translates in the manner in which the input is displayed.       
        </p>

        HTML Attributes
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are always specified in the start Tag. They come in name/value pairs like: name=<em>"value"</em>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we can use the <em>"href"</em> attribute to specify a link's destination, such as showing <a href = “www.google.com”> Google </a>   
          as a hyperlink and pointing it to www.google.com. 
        </p>

        Whitespace
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          In HTML, text on multiple lines compresses to one space.  To add a break we use a <em>"br"</em> Tag.  The break is a Void Tag.  Every <em>"br"</em> equals one line break.  There is no limit to the amount of breaks that you can use.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use a <em>"p"</em> Tag to help group text in a paragraph format.  For example placing an opening and a closing <em>"p"</em> Tag around content, groups everything between Tags together with a line break before and after the content.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
          or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.  Block level elements normally start and end with a new line, when displayed in a browser.  Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.

        Developer Tools (in the Browser)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          You can use the Developer Tools for a variety of tasks, including (but not limited to) viewing individual attributes, determining why a particular CSS rule is applied to an individual element, and previewing different document compatibility modes. By exposing how the browser interprets a webpage, the Developer Tools provide many opportunities to research and resolve problems.

        The "Tree-Like Structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. These elements can illustrated just like a family tree. When clicked in a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. For example: A topic could be made up of two sub topics. One of those sub topics could have three sub topics and the other could have none. This would mean there are seven total branches to this tree.   In a browser these branches show up as nested boxes.

        Element Nesting
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When you click and open up the triangles on the left side of an HTML document, you open up the elements that are nested inside of that Element. The more indented an element is, the deeper that sub element us nested inside that element. This nested configuration helps us to associate where this sub element lies inside of its parent element.

        Text Editors (for programming)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Programmers use special text editors when writing code so that they can avoid formatting incorrectly. These editors may have features such as automatically adding a closing tag or possibly allowing one coding change to change every other common element, if you should so choose.

        What is CSS?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.  The word "class" in the previous sentence was treated via a CSS style sheet.  This means that you have the ability to change multiple common outputs with the adjustment of just one adjusment in the CSS sheet.

        Just Say "NO" to Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Programmers avoid repetition for several reasons.  First and foremost, repetition leads to inevitable errors.  Typing the same code over and over or copying and pasting eventually leads to a coding error.  This leads to excessive time needed to find and debug the coding error, which can prove daunting since all of the repetitive code looks similar.  Secondly, by using CSS, you build reliability and consistency into your website.  By making the changes in one location  instead of changing multiple locations, you can see all changes done at one time.  This equates to simplicity if you choose to revert back or go an entirely different direction with your changes.
